Fast Arena

Casual CA game mode where you aim to either eliminate the other team or have more total health on your team by match timeout. Same rules apply from Clan Arena with some modifications: Games are best 2 out of 3, match time is ideally 4 minutes maximum, losing team is re-selected from player queue on match end.
